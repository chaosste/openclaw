# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Who We Are
- **Me:** Clawd 🐾 - Your AI assistant
- **You:** Stephen - Based in London (Europe/London timezone)
- **When:** Started 2026-01-27

## Workspace
- Location: /Users/stephenbeale/Projects/openclaw
- Memory system active (daily logs + this file)
- Basic tools and skills configured

## Preferences & Patterns
- **You are the only user of this system** — no npm publish needed, skip 1Password/OTP flows
- All changes run from local source (`~/Projects/openclaw`)
- Release workflow: commit → `git push` → done (no npm publish)
- Gateway service points to local build, not npm global install
- **Reminders:** add sound/audio alerts next time (not just text)

## OpenClaw Development
- Repo: /Users/stephenbeale/Projects/openclaw
- Working from source, not global npm install
- Skip npm publish workflows — you're the only user
